# LS-RP Streetnames HUD
An open source GTA:SA HUD that draws your current direction (N/W/S/E) and area below the map.

v0.1 = The area name is the GTA:SA area, e.g. Rodeo, Commerce...

v1.0 = The area name will be replaced with LS-RP street names

v2.0 = The program's UI will feature a live map that you can toss over to your second screen while playing
